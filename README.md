# Crack-The-Enigma
Memory game project
School project for SDD. This game is a memory game in which the player must stop the U-boats from sinking allied ships by cracking the Enigma Code.
A jumble of letters and numbers appear before the player for a few seconds. The player must enter the code to stop the U-boats. The time limit decreases as difficulty increases over time.
